As a botanist who travels often and all over the world, I would like to know the climate and how that can affect the plants growing and species wherever I go. When I am on an adventure trip to Amazon Rainforest. I want to get a heads-up of what plants and fruit I will see along the way. I heard from my friends that there is a website that can help with finding plants all over the world with the best season to grow them. Therefore,  I go to the Facebook credentials page to create my web account. I can use it immediately when I land. Once I logged in, the system locates where I am automatically. I see my location on the page and I can edit it by city and zip code if the location is not accurate or my location isnâ€™t updated. The information on the vegetables and fruits is comprehensive and covers almost everything. I have a preview of what I am going to see in the forest, along with the approximate season and weather that plants can grow. When I visit Cuba. I do some research before I leave. I simply typed in the city and all the information come out. For instance, Plantains and bananas account for 47% and 24% of the local production, with some other fruit such as papayas, mango, and etc. It is a great way to get a better idea of the local culture and really helpful for my research.
