As a botanist who travels often and all over the world, I would like to know the climate and how that can affect the plants growing and species wherever I go. While I go on an adventure trip to the Amazon Rainforest. I want to get a heads-up of what plants and fruit I will see along the way. I heard from my friends that there is a website that can help with finding plants all over the world with the best season to grow them. Therefore,  I go to the Facebook credentials page to create my web account. I can use it immediately when I land. Once I logged in, I simply type in the plants that I am looking for. Then the picture of it comes out with a description. If I am interested in that, I can save it as my favorite so that I  can check it later. The information on the vegetables and fruits is comprehensive and covers almost everything. I have a preview of what I am going to see in the forest, along with the approximate season and weather that plants can grow. When I visit Cuba. I do some research before I leave. I simply typed in the city and all the information come out. For instance, Plantains and bananas account for 47% and 24% of the local production, with some other fruit such as papayas, mango, and etc. It is a great way to get a better idea of the local culture and really helpful for my research. Also, I am interested in cooking with those plants and fruits. The web extends links for recipes. For bananas, it comes out with all sorts of related recipes such as banana bread and banana crepes.
