Caelyn Gonzalez: 

As a logged-in user, I want to start a personal record of plants that I intend to grow and organize it. I want to do this through the app by finding suitable plant species for my area and saving each one to a personal list within the app. I use my facebook credentials to log into the app. The app displays a new screen with the option to start a search, and I enter my location into the search bar. A list of suitable plants for my location and climate is returned. I click the “save” button on each plant species I am interested in. This records the species and its information in a personal list, which can always be accessed from a button at the top of the screen. I then click my personal list, go to the header of the list, and click the button that says “add subcategory.” It opens a textbox where I enter a custom name for the subcategory, and it gets added to my list. I then find a plant I have already saved, click “add to subcategory…” and select the subcategory I would like to move it to. It then moves and appears below the header I chose. After I am done, I log out of the app and my information is saved.
