Caelyn Gonzalez: 

As a logged-in user, I want to start a personal record of fruits that I want to incorporate into my diet. I want to do this through the app by searching for fruits and saving them within the app. I use my Google credentials to log into the app. The app displays a new screen with a search bar, where I search for a specific fruit. I click on the fruit and am presented with its basic information, such as health benefits, and then a list of recipes containing the fruit. I can click a “favorite” button to save the fruit to my favorites list. After I am done, I log out of the app and my information is saved.
