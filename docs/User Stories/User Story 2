Hector Ramirez: Aspiring gardener in New York City

As a gardener living in a New York city apartment year round, I would like to know what tropical plants I might be able to grow in the current season, Fall. To do this I log into the website and use my facebook credentials to access the website quickly. Since I have location permissions off on my device, the website isn’t able to automatically give me suggestions, so I enter the name of my city into the search bar and hit enter. After a couple of moments, the website returns no matches. The weather in the Fall is far too cold for tropical plants. Instead, the website returns the best times of the year in New York for me to be able to grow any tropical plants. Seeing that I might be able to grow kiwis in the springtime, I decided to wait a couple of months so that I may be able to grow some. In the meantime, I click on the result for kiwis in order to get some more growing and cultivation information about them from the database. Satisfied with kiwis, I click on the “read later” on the Kiwi page. Once springtime comes around, I once again access the website and log in with the same account as before. Instead of going through the search bar and making another search, I click on the “read later” button near the top of the website. This takes me to a page that has all the plants I had opted to save in this section. I scroll down to the entry for kiwis and am taken to the page I had seen earlier during the Fall. I skim the information on kiwis again and log out of the website.
