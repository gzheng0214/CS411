Hector Ramirez: Lifelong New York City resident, young adult

As someone who has lived in New York City his whole life, I've had little to no knowledge of the health benefits of many tropical fruits. Now that I've moved out of my parents place, on top of learning how to cook, I'd like to learn how to start learning to eat healthier now that I am fully responsible for my body. After some reasearch, I found a website that might help give me ideas on how to incorporate more unfamiliar fruits and vegetables into my diet as well as teach me what they can do for me healthwise. After entering the website, I'm prompted to log in with my google account before being greeted by a search bar. Since I have some bananas laying around, I do a search for bananas. This takes me to results page, the first results, predictably, being bananas. After I click on the result for bananas, I am taken to a section of the website full of health information about bananas as well as links to and images of banana recipes online. Since there's quite a few results, and I have quite a few bananas, I decide to save this page for later using the favorite button near the top of the page. For now though, I decide to click on the link for glutten free banana pancakes, which takes me to a third party website with the recipe. After reading the recipe and getting my ingredients out, I close the third party website and log out of the fruit website, closing all tabs. I will most likely log back in some other day once I'm hungry for bananas again.
