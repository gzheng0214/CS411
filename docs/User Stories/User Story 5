Gavin:
	As a person who knows nothing about plants and has an upcoming assignment due, I want to learn more about tropical plants, so that I can write about them. When I log in, there is a search bar on top of the page, where I can type in a plantâ€™s name to quickly search for it or click view all to view all of the plants. After clicking on a plant that interests me, it will bring me to a page that gives me more information on the plant. I want to save the link to read later, so there is a favorite button which I can use to favorite the specific plant. There is a favorites page where I can see the list of plants that I have favorited and click on one of them to quickly bring me to the page on it. On the plant page, I can view more information on it and see some recipes associated with the plant. I want to like the page, so I can go back to it without having to search for it again. When I log out, it should bring me back to the login page, where you have to login again.
