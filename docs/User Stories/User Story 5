Gavin:
	As a person who knows nothing about plants and has an upcoming assignment due, I want to learn more about tropical plants, so that I can write about them. I want to be able to learn more about the plants without having to create an account because I just want to do my assignment. I click on a link in the sidebar to look at a list of all the tropical plants and look through the list to find anything that might be of interest to me. There is a search bar on top of the page, where I can type in a plant’s name to quickly filter the list. After clicking on a plant that interests me, it will bring me to a page that gives me more information on the plant. I want to save the link to read later, but since I don’t have an account I can’t store the information elsewhere. To make it more convenient for me in the future, I made an account so that I can favorite the page. After logging in, I can see the list of plants that I saved and click on one of them to quickly bring me to the page on it. As I go through the website, I notice that it has a lot of features that make it useful to grow my own tropical plants. There is a link on the sidebar that brings me to a page that shows me all the plants that could be grown in the current weather in my city. On that page, there is also a textbox, where I can input another address to check for plants that can be grown at that address. I can click on any of the plants and it will bring me to a page containing information about the plant. I want to like the page, so I can go back to it when I start growing the plants without having to search for it again. When I log out, it should bring me back to the home page, where no sensitive information is displayed.
