As a mom of 3 I am tired of overpaying for the fruits and vegetables I can get at the grocery store. They have a great variety but they never taste right, I am pretty sure they are just not cultivating the right plants for this season! So I decided to do a little bit of research to see If I would be able to do it by myself. I log into my facebook account and start looking for a group that talks about tropical plants and how to get started in growing plants at home.I finally find a link to a website which allows you to see the best tropical plants to grow depending on the weather of your city and season of the year that we are currently in! So I decided to take a look at it. I log in with my Facebook credentials, I put my city in the search bar and click enter. The website sent over 10 recommendations of plants to grow in this season of the year. I click one of the links to see how good of a website it is. I get redirected to a new portal in which I can see the fruit I selected alongside information about how to grow it and the specific months of the year in which I should do it. However, I just realized I am late to pick up my children for football so I add the 3 results into my Read Later List and close the computer without getting out of the website. When I came back home, I tried to search up again, but the website had timed out. Luckily enough, when I reload the page, I see that my reading list still has the 3 items that I put in for reading later, so I go into the Read Later section and start getting ready to learn how to grow my own fruits and vegetables!
