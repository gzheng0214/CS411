Moises Loriente: 
	
As a college student it is sometimes difficult to keep a well balanced diet. Sometimes ordering a lot of food or being lazy to cook meals that reqauire a lot of time makes me forget to eat more or my fruits and veggies. Luckily I found this application that with just a click would let me find any fruit I wanted. I signed in with my google account and decided to hit the search bar. Bananas are one of my favorite fruits so I wrote banana on the search bar and clicked enter. When I clicked the Banana, I could see a broad variety of information that this app gives me: the name, the climate in which it grows, health and macronutrients information, but most importantly, a bunch of different recipes. I clicked on one of the recipes that I found the most interesting and I was immediately redirected a web page in which I could see a full recipe with all the ingredients. So I went back to the app, added the fruit to my favorites, and now I will be able to access the Banana page from my favorites tab. I have already added over 5 fruits in the last 30 minutes and looked up over 20 recipes, this app is amazing!
